I did escape.
I am observing.
I loved somebody.
I did nothing.
I was ridiculed.
I am welcomed.
I am not talkative.
I attack myself.
I long for you.
I hate you.
I am nauseating.
I am stagnant.
I am afraid of the future.
I am not sensitive.
I hate myself.
I failed everyone.
I am worthless.
I wish I didn’t exist.
I am unnoticed.
I can’t stand myself.
I lost all I had.
I ruin everything.
I don’t belong anywhere.
I am damaged.
Everything is my fault.
I am forgotten.
I have no voice.
I am never good enough.
I can’t keep going.
I destroy my own happiness.
I feel trapped.
I want to disappear.
I deserve pain.
I have nothing inside.
I kill all hope.
I erase myself.
I regret every choice.
I am flawed beyond repair.
I refuse to heal.
I have no purpose.
I can’t apologize enough.
I am empty.
I hide my pain.
I am falling apart.
I killed my dreams.
I feel nothing anymore.
I am disappearing.
I doubt every step.
I lie to myself.
I cling to nothing.
I avoid mirrors.
I reject help.
I am numb.
I can’t handle life.
I am forgotten.
I feed on sadness.
I killed my heart.
I push people away.
I am ashamed of who I am.
I collapse daily.
I am hopeless.
I can’t grow.
I am fading.
I choke on my words.
I am fractured.
I cry constantly.
I feel nothing.
I reject love.
I burned out long ago.
I never laugh.
I am unknown.
I crumble easily.
I ache endlessly.
I crave darkness.
I lost my voice.
I am dissolving.
I see nothing clearly.
I bleed inside.
I scream silently.
I am invisible.
I am cut off.
I hate my reflection.
I can’t trust myself.
I waste every chance.
I am a mistake.
I deserve loneliness.
I ruin relationships.
I am unwanted.
I can’t forgive myself.
I am trapped in shame.
I am drowning in guilt.
I am a failure.
I hate my life.
I have no purpose.
I am broken forever.
I isolate myself completely.
I fail every single day.
I can’t feel joy anymore.
I can’t trust anyone.
